Credit Risk Analysis

The purpose of doing analysis on this data set is to look at the loans people have taken and find the risk
of them defaulting on payments and catagorize them into healthy(0) and high-risk(1).

* The accuracy of the machine learning model determining if a loan is high-risk or healthy is 99%, this is an almost perfect model 
* The percision of the model was 100% for healthy loans and 85% for high-risk
* The recall for the model was 99% for healthy loans and 89% for high-risk
* The F-1 score for healthy loans was 100% and 87% for high-risk found by this machine learning model

Looking at these scores we are able to tell that the model had a farely easy and accurate time determining which loans were healthy
it had a harder time determining which loans were high-risk always having a 10% or more difference betweeen the 2. I wouldnt recommend
the model in its current state for the company to use, while the overall accuracy is great at 99% a few parameters can be added and some 
aspcets of the model can be changed to get the percision, recall and f-1 score up for high-risk loans. These are the types of loans that
banks would lose money on so the accuracy needs to be higher to recommend it be used.
